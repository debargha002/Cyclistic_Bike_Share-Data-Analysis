# Cyclistic_Bike_Share-Data-Analysis
This capstone project is the final project in my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. In this case study I will be analyzing a public dataset for a fictional company provided by the course. I used R programming language and Kaggle notebook for this analysis because of its easy statistical analysis tools.
